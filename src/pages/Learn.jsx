                        In the CompTIA portion of the course, all readings, assignments, quizes, and practice exams will be done
                        in CompTIA's CertMaster Learn portal. CertMaster Learn offers numerous tools to help you prepare for the A+
                        exams. I highly recommend that you study using the practice exams under the Assessments tab.
